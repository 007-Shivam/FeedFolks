# FeedFolks

This Github repository contains the source code for a mobile application designed to assist in feeding people in need. The UI has been created using Figma, a popular design tool that allows for the creation of highly customizable and responsive designs.

The app allows users to easily pin the location of individuals or groups in need of food assistance and sends this information to NGOs and individuals who wish to donate food. The app utilizes Google Maps to accurately pinpoint locations and includes a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and use.
